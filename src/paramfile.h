// The point is that a look found by dragging sliders can then drive a batch or
// a video render -- which is the CLI's job -- without being retyped as thirty
// --flags with one of them wrong. The format is `key value` lines so it stays
// diffable and hand-editable; `#` starts a comment.

// and the derived fields in TuningParams are filled in by the pipeline every
